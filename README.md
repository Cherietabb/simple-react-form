# Simple React Contact Form
I created this repo to teach myself how to build and validate forms using React.


## Used to create app:
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>
Node.js v6.11.0 or later<br>
[Material-UI](www.material-ui.com) for styling.

### Getting Started
Clone or fork this repo and run `yarn install`

### `npm start` 
Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
